The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application for Ask DD, a 24/7 AI Sales Agent landing page. The initial phase focused on frontend development with mock data, incorporating specific design guidelines and UI patterns (bronze/orange primary, blue accent). Key features like a contact form modal for demo bookings, dynamic content sections (hero, features, pricing), and integration of provided screenshots were implemented.

The subsequent phase involved backend integration for email submission, which encountered SMTP authentication issues with Gmail. This task was paused by the user. Later, the user requested numerous frontend design adjustments, including header/footer style changes, content reordering, specific feature emphasis with new images, removal of Made with Emergent branding, and integrating a third-party chatbot widget.

A significant challenge involved persistent dark mode display issues and incorrect color schemes on Netlify deployment, which required aggressive CSS and Tailwind config modifications to force a light theme. The final major feature implemented was an animated features carousel, replacing a static image, which required  and careful syntax correction. The chatbot widget integration was also validated to be working.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture:


-   ****: Main React application file, responsible for routing and integrating all sections of the landing page. It orchestrates the display of various components.
-   ****: Global CSS file, configured with Tailwind CSS directives and custom CSS variables based on the Green-ai playbook. It defines the overall theme and base styles, and was heavily modified to resolve dark mode issues and re-apply the correct color scheme.
-   ****: Tailwind CSS configuration, defining color palettes, border radii, keyframes, and animations. Modified to disable automatic dark mode detection () and to make Tailwind classes  for forcing light mode.
-   ****: Displays the main hero content, including the primary call-to-action button and the Meet Ask DD: Your 24/7 AI Agent title. Modified to remove the Watch Demo button and update the title's line break.
-   ****: Showcases How Ask DD Transforms Your Business. Initially contained a static image, now replaced with .
-   ****: Lists the key features of Ask DD. Heavily modified to reorder features, emphasize those with images, rename AI-Powered Assessment to AI-Powered Forms, and add Agent Builder Portal. Duplicates were removed.
-   ****: The contact form modal. Updated to support Netlify Forms by removing  validation and adding a  attribute.
-   ****: A newly created component for the features carousel, utilizing  to animate through different feature showcases. Required several fixes for JSX syntax errors (escaped quotes).
-   ****: The page footer. Changed from green to a subtle blue gradient, and the About Us link was updated to .
-   ****: The main HTML entry point. Modified to remove the Made with Emergent badge, update page title/description, and include a hidden form field for Netlify Forms. Also contains the embedded chatbot widget script.
-   ****: Netlify deployment configuration, specifying build command, publish directory, and Node.js version.

<current_work>
The most recent work involved fixing persistent dark mode and color scheme issues on Netlify deployment and successfully implementing an animated features carousel.

The AI engineer aggressively addressed the dark theme problem by:
1.  Setting  in .
2.  Adding an explicit  class to the HTML root and overriding theme-color.
3.  Implementing JavaScript to remove any  class added dynamically.
4.  Adding  to force white backgrounds across , , , and  in .
5.  Setting  in .

After resolving the dark mode issues, the color scheme was reviewed and corrected to ensure the bronze/orange primary and blue accent colors were correctly applied, including vibrant CTA buttons, subtle hero gradients, clean white card backgrounds, and a professional blue footer.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented an **Animated Features Carousel** in , replacing a static image in the How Ask DD Transforms Your Business section. This involved installing  and iteratively fixing JSX syntax errors related to escaped quotes until the carousel animated smoothly through 24/7 Availability, Lead Qualification, Automated Proposals, and Live Analytics. The chatbot widget integration was also verified and is successfully loaded on the page.
